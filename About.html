<h3>
<p> When i was growing up I had to study harshly because I was the third born in my family of geniuses. My parents both are geniuses in my eyes and they work tirelessly to provide for the family. </P>

<p> My sibilings, Brother and Sister are both smart people getting honors and topping what ever class they went to!. 

<p> Me on the other hand, well lets just say I wasnt the most gifted when it came to books but doesnt mean I was dumb either which is the reason I even got into college, but I defiently was inferior to my older siblings.
