      </p>
      <h3>First and for most who am I?
      </h3>
      <p> My name is Kyle Kayvon Clarke, I am currently 19 and the third born from the Clarke family.</p>
      <p> During my youth I was very lonely due to the fact of there wasnt many people around my age and my family did not trust me enough
          to be left alone.
